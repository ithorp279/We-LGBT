## About:

### How Reputations are Figured:
Standings are figured based on current or recent actions. If one positive source is found for any one part of the LGBT+ spectrum, it's assumed that they have a positive stance across the board until evidence of negative actions are found.

The whole Internet starts out with "Not Found" and gets promoted or demoted as we find sources or they're reported to us. 

Currently most of the filter contains companies that signed the <a href=\"http://freemarry.3cdn.net/12510e39d67076ca00_u0m6i2a33.pdf\">amicus brief for gay marriage to the Supreme Court</a> or has shown support by changing their logo after the legalization of equal marriage rights in the U.S.

### Permissions:
- `Read and change your data on the websites you visit` - To view the page you're on to tell you the reputation of the website.
- No data is sent to servers and only the amount of sites you vist is recorded locally (resets after restart).
