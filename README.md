## About:

### How Standings are Figured:
Standings are figured based on current or recent actions. If one positive source is found for any one part of the LGBT+ spectrum, it's assumed that they have a positive stance across the board until evidence of negative actions are found.

The whole Internet starts out with the "not found" and gets promoted as we find sources or they're reported to us. 

Currently most of the filter contains companies that signed the Amicus Brief or has shown support by changing their logo after the legalization of equal marriage rights in the U.S.
